What about visualization?

You might be wondering that we have mentioned everything from support to complexity to production but we haven’t commented on the basic ingredient of data sciences i.e. Data Visualization.

Data Visualization is indeed the first part which is needed even before running your first iteration of the model. There are various examples where graphs can tell a story better than a machine learning algorithm.

As of today Python couldn’t compete with R when it comes to data visualization. ggplot is the best tool to use, which you will find in statistical data visualizations.
